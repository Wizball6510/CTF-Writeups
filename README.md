# Capture The Flag Writeups

In this repository I will be publishing various writeups to CTF Challenges that I've solved, varying from Jeopardy-Style Contests to WarGames *and beyond!*. I'll try to do these frequently, as I myself have learnt the most from writeups, rather than the traditional "hacking tutorials".

I encourage you to attempt to solve a challenge yourself first (if it is still up) and inevitably learn new things along the way. If you then ever feel stuck you can take a quick peek at a writeup to get to the next step. Just keep in mind, the goal isn't to solve the challenge, but to learn something new. Cheers!
